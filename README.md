# E-Commerce Marketing Optimization: README
## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize the marketing budget for an e-commerce company specializing in electronic products in Ontario, Canada. The firm experienced heavy marketing investments but has seen suboptimal returns. The task involves building machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to analyze product categories and uncover insights to improve revenue outcomes.

## Business Objective
To streamline or strategically reallocate the marketing budget to achieve higher ROI by understanding the impact of marketing strategies on revenue, customer behavior, and demand across three product subcategories:

Camera Accessory
Home Audio
Gaming Accessory
Our primary goal is to identify drivers of revenue and recommend actionable steps for marketing optimizations at the weekly level.

## Models Developed
1. Logarithmic & Multiplicative Models
Used for interpretability of marketing levers (log transformations).
2. Machine Learning Models
Random Forest Regression: To assess variable importance for GMV
XGBoost: For robust predictions across non-linear features

3. Deep Learning Models
ANN (Artificial Neural Networks): To capture complex relationships between climate, marketing, and GMV
